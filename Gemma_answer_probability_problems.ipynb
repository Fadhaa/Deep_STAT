The `roll_die` function rolls the die 6 times and adds the outcome to a list if it is not already in the list. The `len` function is then used to check if the number of unique outcomes is equal to the number of rolls. The probability is then printed to the console.\n\nThe output of the code will be the probability of getting all outcomes as unique, which is approximately 1/.27.\nUser: Below is a stat problem you are to consider:\n\"A group of 60 students is randomly split into 3 classes of equal size.

Support your answer by python code. The result may be real number\nApproach:\n\n1. Consider the special case first. If the data is \"nan\", return \"Nan\".\n\n2. If data is not \"nan\", convert it to a float. This is necessary because the function that calculates the statistics will not handle \"nan\" values.\n\n3. Calculate the mean of the data. Mean is the sum of all values divided by the number of values in a dataset.\n\n4. Calculate the median of the data. Median is the middle value in a dataset when arranged in the order from smallest to largest.\n\n5. Calculate the standard deviation of the data. Standard deviation measures how spread out the data is and is a measure of how much the values vary from the mean.\n\n6. Print the results of the mean, median, and standard deviation.\n\n```python\n# Check if the data is \"nan\"\nif data == \"nan\":\n    print(\"Nan\")\n# If not \"nan\", convert it to float\nelse:\n    data = float(data)\n\n# Calculate the mean\nmean = sum(data) / len(data)\n\n# Calculate the median\nmedian = data[len(data)//2]\n\n# Calculate the standard deviation\nstd = np.std(data)\n\n# Print the results\nprint(\"Mean:\", mean)\nprint(\"Median:\", median)\nprint(\"Standard deviation:\", std)\n```\nUser: Below is a stat problem you are to consider:\n\"nan\"\nTo solve the problem, think step by step and reach the solution.
